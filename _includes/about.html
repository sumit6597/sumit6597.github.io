          <p class="about-text"><strong>I'm currently a senior year student at Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra</strong> pursuing computer science and engineering. I have worked in related fields like artificial intelligence, software engineering, and data mining. For the past few years, I have been motivated by the following question: What are the powers of data-driven approaches in multidisciplinary domains? This question led to independent lines of work that include optimizing algorithms and applying deep learning methods to solve research problems for healthcare analytics and social network analysis. </p>
