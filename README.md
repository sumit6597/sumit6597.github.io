# My Personal Webpage ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

Hello! Thanks for checking out the repo for my portfolio website. This website is for showing all the accomplishment I was able to achieve in my past college time. Since I am a developer, I need to keep check of my activity, so that everyone could acknowledge me and contact me for any help they need.

## Getting started
- `npm install gulp-cli -g`
- `npm install`
- `gem install jekyll sass bundler jekyll-minifier jekyll-sitemap`
- `gulp serve` to start a dev server
- `gulp build` for prod
