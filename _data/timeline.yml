  description: Worked on Hate Speech detection of tweets related to Black Lives Matter. Data collected through crowdsourcing, pre-processed, and was subjected to various transformer-based contextual models for experiments. The Paper was virtually presented before the group of panel. The motivation of the work was to build a system for hate speech mitigation from online platforms.
