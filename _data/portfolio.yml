- title: Automated-Medical-Assistance

  code: https://github.com/sumit6597/DocAssistance
  description: We aimed to mitigate the disparity of access to Telehealth among different racial groups. To design and experiment on different transformers based model like BERT, BART, and GPT2, we could generate a doctor response through question answering. The paper “Automated Medical Assistance Attention Based Consultation System” was accepted at NeurIPS 2020.

- title: Misinformation in COVID-19 tweets

  code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wKlBP3t2t8EQQDbku6ZWlQe85_QrTeWf?usp=sharing
  description: We aimed at developing a classifier for fine-grained inference of COVID-19 tweets. Through building a benchmark system for misinformation mitigation and experimenting with classical machine learning approaches to the latest state-of-the-art deep learning models gave me a deeper insight into natural language processing. I presented the work “A Fine-Grained Analysis of Misinformation in COVID-19 Tweets” at the IdeaS conference which got accepted in a special issue of springer named “Computational and Mathematics Organization Theory on Disinformation”.
