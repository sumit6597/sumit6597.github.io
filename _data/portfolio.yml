  code: https://github.com/sumit6597/Automated-Medical-Assistance
  description: We aimed to mitigate the disparity of access to Telehealth among different racial groups. To design and experiment on different transformers based model like BERT, BART, and GPT2, we could generate a doctor response through question answering. The paper “Automated Medical Assistance Attention Based Consultation System” was accepted at NeurIPS 2020.

  code: https://github.com/sumit6597
  description: We aimed at developing a classifier for fine-grained inference of COVID-19 tweets. Through building a benchmark system for misinformation mitigation and experimenting with classical machine learning approaches to the latest state-of-the-art deep learning models gave me a deeper insight into natural language processing. I presented the work “A Fine-Grained Analysis of Misinformation in COVID-19 Tweets” at the IdeaS conference which got accepted in a special issue of springer named “Computational and Mathematics Organization Theory on Disinformation”.

#   description: A simple weather app I made at HubSpot's Fall 2016 Web App Workshop utilizing Node.js, Express, and Heroku. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather and forecast data, and then used the current city's coordinates to create a map background that reflected the current city using the Google Maps API.

  code: https://github.com/AmbiTyga/ASL-Classifier
  description: ASL-Classifier is a python wrapper object. It's a real-time based classifier, helps in detecting and classifying American Sign language. With the help of Haarscascade and opencv it detects palm in the view and uses pretrained keras model in classification. It uses opencv library to create window applications to manage settings and classify output.

#   description: This is just an online version of my resume. I forked it from . I was interested in learning React.js, so I found this <a href="https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/building-your-first-react-js-app-d53b0c98dc#.1439cdewq">simple tutorial</a> and it kind of spun into this weekend project. I probably didn't need to use React at all, but hey, at least I learned a few things!

  code: https://github.com/AmbiTyga/hiLyted
  description: hiLyted is a project which clips highlights of video. It is based on the method of short time energy in audios extracted from a video. It captures the time period containing high pitch sound considering it as audience applause during the tournament. It downloads the video and audio from youtube using youtube-dl and extracts audio feature using Librosa, with the help of MoviePy it clips the time period of the highlights and saves it in a local directory.

#   demo: http://onecardforall.org
#   description: At MullenLowe, I helped build this 2015 holiday site around an algorithm that generated a holiday greeting to each and every person on the planet. We also accounted for newcomers being added at an amazing rate. Overall, the website is a tranquil, animated experience. As new names appear, visitors can watch them fall, like snowflakes, onto a stylized world map. Users can also find their own name and see it as part of the world collective. Check out this short <a href="http://us.mullenlowe.com/work/one-card-for-all/" target="_blank">video</a> describing the project!

#   description: During my first co-op as a creative technologist at Mullen Lowe, I played a major role in the development of this Tumblr site to complement JetBlue's HumanKinda campaign and documentary. The site houses the video documentary at the top, the many graphics created by Mullen for the campaign, and an interactive quiz to determine how "HumanKinda" you are.
